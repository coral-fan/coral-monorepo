        class="c6 c12 c17">Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Coral
        and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION
        WAIVER.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (a) </span><span class="c5">Applicability of Arbitration
        Agreement.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other
        equitable relief as set forth below) between Coral and any User or Registered User that cannot be resolved
        informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under
        the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be
        held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Coral, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates,
        agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
        unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (b) </span><span class="c5">Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute
        Resolution</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first
        send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;</span><span
        class="c2">) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
        dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Coral should be sent to:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;100
        Maspeth Ave. Unit 6N Brooklyn NY 11211.</span><span class="c2">. After the Notice is received, you and Coral
        may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Coral do not resolve the claim or dispute
        within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The
        amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
        arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c8">13.2 (c ) </span><span class="c2">Arbitration Rules. &nbsp;Arbitration shall be
        initiated through the American Arbitration Association (</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;</span><span
        class="c2">), an established alternative dispute resolution
        provider (</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">) that offers
        arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to
        select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
        arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to
        the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (</span><span
        class="c4">&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">) governing the arbitration are available
        online at </span><span class="c8"><a class="c25" href="https://www.adr.org/"><u>www.adr.org</u>
        </a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. &nbsp;The arbitration
        shall be conducted by a
        single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than
        Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration,
        at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
        is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
        Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you
        reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the
        U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral
        hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that
        Coral made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, Coral will pay you the greater of the award or
        $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and disbursements arising
        out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (d) </span><span class="c5">Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based
        Arbitration</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration
        shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner
        shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
        appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (e) </span><span class="c5">Time Limits.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; If
        you or Coral pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute
        of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
        Rules for the pertinent claim.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.3 (f) </span><span class="c5">Authority of Arbitrator</span><span class="c2">.
        &nbsp;If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
        Coral, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
        parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
        The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
        relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
        issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
        the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority
        to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
        arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Coral.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (g) </span><span class="c5">Waiver of Jury Trial.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;
        THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE
        A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
        arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
        efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a
        court. &nbsp;In the event any litigation should arise between you and Coral in any state or federal court in
        a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CORAL WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
        TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (h) </span><span class="c5">Waiver of Class or Consolidated
        Actions</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
        AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF
        MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
        OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c8 c12">13.2 (i) </span><span class="c5">Confidentiality</span><span class="c2">.
        &nbsp;All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
        and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
        unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law
        any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive
        or equitable relief.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (j) </span><span class="c5">Severability</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;If
        any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall
        be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (k) </span><span class="c5">Right to Waive.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;
        Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party
        against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this
        Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (l) </span><span class="c5">Survival of Agreement</span><span class="c2">.

</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (m) </span><span class="c5">Small Claims Court.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Coral may bring an individual action in small
        claims court.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (n) </span><span class="c5">Emergency Equitable Relief</span><span class="c2">.
        &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a
        state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
        measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
        Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (o) </span><span class="c5">Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. </span><span
        class="c2">&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and
        Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark or

<p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8">13.2 (p) </span><span class="c5">Courts.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; In any

        New York, for such purpose.</span></p>
